Add Docker-Workflow to Jenkins Plugins
First, we'll need to add the Jenkins Docker-Workflow plugin.
 We could add this every time we start Jenkins from the GUI (like we did with the "Recommended Plugins),
  but automating the process saves us that manual effort.

Use your editor of choice to add this line to the end of the dockerfile at ~/jenkinsdocker/dockerfile:

RUN /usr/local/bin/install-plugins.sh docker-workflow



docker jenkins setup
